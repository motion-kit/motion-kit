  about:
    After working on Teacup for almost two years, I decided that we needed an
    overhaul. Teacup has embraced too much complexity, and it has very few
    commiters, even though it was always meant to be a community project.

    MotionKit is a collaboration between Jamon and myself, and I hope that makes
    it more accessible to the community in general. Plus it has a much lighter
    footprint - it is as much an opinion on code organization as it is a layout
    and styling DSL!

  about:
    Jamon created ProMotion to enable rapid application development, and to make
    obtuse or verbose parts of Cocoa more intuitive.
